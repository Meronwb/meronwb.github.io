# Work Experience (only last 10 years)

##  Merrill Gardens at Renton Centre(Renton, WA)

** Waitress 
** (December 2021– Aug  2022)

As a waitress, I’d take orders, serve food and drinks, and make sure customers have a great experience. I’d also handle payments, clean tables, and work with the kitchen to keep things running smoothly. This job required me to apply my skills within communication, multitasking, and the energy to stay on my feet. It was a heavily fast-paced environment considering we were understaffed.  I built caring relationships with residents, contributing to a welcoming atmosphere and repeat satisfaction. I consistently balanced multiple tables while maintaining accuracy and attention to detail, and I collaborated with teammates and management to ensure smooth service during busy meal times and special events.
